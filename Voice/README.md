# Overview

This is a modification in progress...basically adding a speech processing feature to the former game.

## Usage

Open up two terminals side by side to the specific directory and work on them simultaneously.
 
* On the 1st terminal and type the command- "pocketsphinx_continuous -inmic yes -lm 9731.lm -dict 9731.dic > decode.txt"
* On the second terminal run- "python3 Game-voice.py"

## Progress

The work is still in progress, the required improvements will be added soon.
